<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! My name is Airra Jane Sahagun. I graduated Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering back in 2020. Now, I am working
  as a Quality Engineer at a semi-conductor manufacturing company here in Batangas. I am happy with my career but I really
  want to be a woman in tech. I envision myself as a webdeveloper for lots of big clients all around the world. That is why,
  I am taking this 12 weeks of web development bootcamp course in Udemy. So far, I am loving it. I reallt can't wait to finish it.

  I love animals. That is why, I have lots of pets. Currently, I have 15 cats and 2 dogs. I am sure that if I put their names here,
  you'll probably skip reading them, so I won't. I also love watching movies and television series. Other people will tell you if you
  ask them about their hobbies would be playing an instrument or reading books. But for me, it's definitely watching good pop culture movies.
  I also love to watch animes if I am out of television series to watch. I can definitely finish a 4 part series in one day and if I like it,
  I'll bing watch the series again. That's how dedicated I am.

  Career shifting would be a very hard challenge for me but as long as I know the purpose of what I'm doing and why I am doing it, I'll get through
  this in no time.
